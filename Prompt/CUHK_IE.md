现在要针对我的留学文书进行修改，下面是我PS的内容，添加有关CUHK的特色内容，比如哪些课程是很吸引我，相关程度很高。增加的内容用英文写作，并符合文书的规范要求。
下面是PS内容：

## 原中文部分
我最初的兴趣源于小时候读科幻小说。在阿西莫夫的机器人系列小说中，我被一个叫丹尼尔的人形机器人深深地吸引了，他拥有一个“正子脑”，能够模拟人类的感受和思考，并且拥有超强的记忆力和处理能力。我对这个机器人产生了非常深刻的印象，并好奇这些智能人形机器人的可实现性？到了中学阶段，随着对自然科学的深入学习，我不满足于虚构的科幻，而是从身边的实物开始探索和了解。从简单的电视遥控器、电热水壶到玩具能控制飞行姿态和位置的无人机，我都将它们的外壳拆开过，看到了复杂的PCB板和上面的各种元件和芯片，这些设备尤其是其中的电路芯片的精密构造使我着迷，促使我不断思考他们是如何实现各种复杂功能的，尤其是软件和硬件是如何协同工作的。

到了大学，为了（在电子领域）获得一个更为广阔和全面的视野，我修读了自动化专业。这个专业将传统电子、控制理论与AI技术结合，有丰富的课程内容。我在学习控制理论的过程中掌握了使用线性代数等数学工具进行分析和计算的能力，在学习数电模电课程的同时还通过实际DC-DC电路的设计和分析获得了实践，在数字图像处理和模式识别等课程中，我将所学的理论知识和算法在ROS和linux环境中通过编程进行实现。在本科阶段丰富的课程中我打下了较为扎实的数学、电路、编程和控制基础。  

我并不仅仅满足于理论知识的学习，也在课余时间积极参与实际项目的制作。在大一我参与完成了一个智能自行车码表的项目。这是我第一次接触到完整的产品开发流程，当时我对于如何开发一个产品毫无概念，于是我们项目团队的成员先去开源社区和论坛寻找设计思路和教程，然后经过讨论初步确定了几版方案思路交由指导老师进行审阅。但当方案确定后，其实我们对于具体的开发还无从下手，于是将项目根据功能和模块分为显示屏、GPS定位、陀螺仪姿态估计等几个部分，每个人针对一到两个部分开展自学。在硬件部分我们学习了PCB原理图的绘制，自己完成了元器件和电路板的焊接。在软件部分我们自己阅读官方开发文档完成了esp-idf开发环境的配置，学习示例工程中蓝牙等功能的写法并加以修改。在各自模块功能完成后我提议编写了一些API接口和使用实例说明，让调用这些功能模块更为方便。  

在完成这个项目之后，我熟悉了从软件到硬件的基本开发流程，了解了从零开始进行开发和学习的过程，也初步感受到了分工协作的必要性。在接下来的时间里，我还参与了几个项目，对电子领域各个方面也进行了更为深入的学习。在项目开发中并不仅满足于基本功能的实现，而开始注重规范性和满足各种指标要求。其中有代表性的是一个物流搬运比赛机器人。在这个机器人项目中，我设计了STM32的拓展板，集成了降压模块、串口模块、供电接口和信号线，还集成了无线继电器开关和无线调试器等，相比之前的项目在供电安全、信号隔离等多种方面有了更为全面的考量。我也负责开发机器人的软件控制部分，通过步进电机配合陀螺仪控制机器人四轮底盘实现精准快速移动，对工程的各个模块进行了合理的代码结构封装，可以适应不同功能需求的开发修改。还采用了更为规范的代码版本管理，便于进行协同开发和修改。在完成这个项目的过程中，我的代码能力得到了明显的提升，积累了更为规范的工程管理和项目制作经验，也通过从具体负责和实现从硬件电路到软件功能的各种设计实现，积累了扎实的软硬件实践经验，对电子领域的各个分支有了更加综合全面的感受和理解。  

在进行理论课程学习和完成实际项目的过程中，我遇到了许多问题，在进行控制器设计时只会使用最简单的PID进行控制，对于更复杂的控制理论缺乏足够的了解。在进行PCB版图设计时仍然对信号完整性、高速信号布线和一些电路的实现原理知之甚少。在进行机器人开发时，对于一些底层的指令集架构和程序运行原理仍是一知半解。于是我迫切希望进行更为深入的学习。
