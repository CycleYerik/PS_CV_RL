What makes a smart device intelligent? This question poped in my mind when I read the robot novel of Asimov. Since then, I start to think about the working principle of various smart devices. 

Once my remote control car was broken, I disassembled it and was immedieately attrctied by the complex PCB and various chips. I was desire to understand the functions of various chips in PCB and how it drives the motor. After graduation from high school, driven by a strong interest in electronic engineering and interdisciplinary studies, I chose the Automation major at Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), which has a strong engineering background.




What's the basic software and hardware principles and control theories of all kinds of electronic devices? This is the main content of my undergraduate study.

After learning the analog and digital eletronics, I designed and soldered a  PCB of a buck-boost converter and got familiar with the basic process hardware design. When it came to control theories, I caculated and analyzed the frequency response of a control system with linear algebra. I also wrote some matlab scipts to do the simulation, which improved my ability of math and programming. With all those fundation above, I deployed some machine vision algorithms on the ROS robot platform, which achieved the color recognition and target tracking. With a theoritical beckground in AI, I also implemented a U-net network with pytorch and the model showed 90% recognition accuracy.


What fascinates me more is the process of giving intelligence to a device myself rather than just understanding the working principle. So I participated in many projects and competitions.


In my freshman year, I participated in a project of a smart bicycle computer. Due to our lackness of related develop experience, we refered to manual and had to learn from the ground up. I was responsible for the driver required by GPS module, bluetooth module and e-paper module. We finally made a bike computer with speed display, fall detection, GPS positioning and 10h battery life. During the project, I went through the whole process of hardware and software development, which profoundly strengthened my interest and passion for Electronics Engineering. Since then, I began to participate in more projects and competitions, learned the PCB design and often explored open-source repositories on GitHub. Impressed by the open-source projects, I realized that I was not content with a merely funtional device. A well designed and optimized one was what I aspired to create.
