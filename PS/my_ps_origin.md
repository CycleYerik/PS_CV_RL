## 写作思路



## 正文
我最初的兴趣源于小时候读科幻小说。在阿西莫夫的机器人系列小说中，我被一个叫丹尼尔的人形机器人深深地吸引了，他拥有一个“正子脑”，能够模拟人类的感受和思考，并且拥有超强的记忆力和处理能力。我对这个机器人产生了非常深刻的印象，并好奇这些智能人形机器人的可实现性？到了中学阶段，随着对自然科学的深入学习，我不满足于虚构的科幻，而是从身边的实物开始探索和了解。从简单的电视遥控器、电热水壶到玩具能控制飞行姿态和位置的无人机，我都将它们的外壳拆开过，看到了复杂的PCB板和上面的各种元件和芯片，这些设备尤其是其中的电路芯片的精密构造使我着迷，促使我不断思考他们是如何实现各种复杂功能的，尤其是软件和硬件是如何协同工作的。

到了大学，为了（在电子领域）获得一个更为广阔和全面的视野，我修读了自动化专业。这个专业将传统电子、控制理论与AI技术结合，有丰富的课程内容。我在学习控制理论的过程中掌握了使用线性代数等数学工具进行分析和计算的能力，在学习数电模电课程的同时还通过实际DC-DC电路的设计和分析获得了实践，在数字图像处理和模式识别等课程中，我将所学的理论知识和算法在ROS和linux环境中通过编程进行实现。在本科阶段丰富的课程中我打下了较为扎实的数学、电路、编程和控制基础。  

我并不仅仅满足于理论知识的学习，也在课余时间积极参与实际项目的制作。在大一我参与完成了一个智能自行车码表的项目。这是我第一次接触到完整的产品开发流程，当时我对于如何开发一个产品毫无概念，于是我们项目团队的成员先去开源社区和论坛寻找设计思路和教程，然后经过讨论初步确定了几版方案思路交由指导老师进行审阅。但当方案确定后，其实我们对于具体的开发还无从下手，于是将项目根据功能和模块分为显示屏、GPS定位、陀螺仪姿态估计等几个部分，每个人针对一到两个部分开展自学。在硬件部分我们学习了PCB原理图的绘制，自己完成了元器件和电路板的焊接。在软件部分我们自己阅读官方开发文档完成了esp-idf开发环境的配置，学习示例工程中蓝牙等功能的写法并加以修改。在各自模块功能完成后我提议编写了一些API接口和使用实例说明，让调用这些功能模块更为方便。  

在完成这个项目之后，我熟悉了从软件到硬件的基本开发流程，了解了从零开始进行开发和学习的过程，也初步感受到了分工协作的必要性。在接下来的时间里，我还参与了几个项目，对电子领域各个方面也进行了更为深入的学习。在项目开发中并不仅满足于基本功能的实现，而开始注重规范性和满足各种指标要求。其中有代表性的是一个物流搬运比赛机器人。在这个机器人项目中，我设计了STM32的拓展板，集成了降压模块、串口模块、供电接口和信号线，还集成了无线继电器开关和无线调试器等，相比之前的项目在供电安全、信号隔离等多种方面有了更为全面的考量。我也负责开发机器人的软件控制部分，通过步进电机配合陀螺仪控制机器人四轮底盘实现精准快速移动，对工程的各个模块进行了合理的代码结构封装，可以适应不同功能需求的开发修改。还采用了更为规范的代码版本管理，便于进行协同开发和修改。在完成这个项目的过程中，我的代码能力得到了明显的提升，积累了更为规范的工程管理和项目制作经验，也通过从具体负责和实现从硬件电路到软件功能的各种设计实现，积累了扎实的软硬件实践经验，对电子领域的各个分支有了更加综合全面的感受和理解。  

在进行理论课程学习和完成实际项目的过程中，我遇到了许多问题，在进行控制器设计时只会使用最简单的PID进行控制，对于更复杂的控制理论缺乏足够的了解。在进行PCB版图设计时仍然对信号完整性、高速信号布线和一些电路的实现原理知之甚少。在进行机器人开发时，对于一些底层的指令集架构和程序运行原理仍是一知半解。于是我迫切希望进行更为深入的学习。

My initial interest in technology was sparked in childhood by reading science fiction. In Isaac Asimov's robot series, I was deeply captivated by a humanoid robot named Daneel, who possessed a "positronic brain" capable of simulating human feelings and thoughts, coupled with exceptional memory and processing power. This depiction left a profound impression on me and ignited my curiosity about the feasibility of realizing such intelligent humanoid robots. In middle school, as I delved deeper into the natural sciences, my interest moved beyond fictional concepts towards exploring and understanding the real-world objects around me. From simple television remotes and electric kettles to toy drones capable of controlling flight attitude and position, I frequently opened their casings. Inside, I saw complex PCB boards populated with various components and chips. The intricate design of these devices, especially the integrated circuits, deeply fascinated me and led me to constantly ponder how they achieved their complex functions, particularly how software and hardware worked together.
Arriving at university, I chose to major in Automation Engineering to gain a broader and more comprehensive perspective in the field of electronics. This program effectively integrates traditional electronics, control theory, and AI technologies through a rich and varied curriculum. While studying control theory, I gained proficiency in using mathematical tools like linear algebra for analysis and calculation. Parallel to learning digital and analog electronics, I acquired practical experience through the hands-on design and analysis of actual DC-DC circuits. In courses such as Digital Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, I implemented learned theories and algorithms through programming in ROS and Linux environments. These diverse undergraduate courses provided me with a solid foundation in mathematics, circuits, programming, and control systems.
Not content with merely theoretical learning, I actively engaged in hands-on projects during my spare time. In my first year, I participated in completing a smart bicycle computer project. This was my first exposure to the full product development process. Having no prior concept of how to develop a product from scratch, our team members first sought design ideas and tutorials from open-source communities and online forums. After thorough discussion, we preliminarily determined several potential solutions to be reviewed by our advisor. Even after the solution was decided, we initially felt unsure how to proceed with the actual development. Consequently, we collaboratively divided the project into several functional modules such as display, GPS positioning, and gyroscope attitude estimation, with each member undertaking self-directed learning for one or two parts. For the hardware, we learned PCB schematic design and independently completed the component soldering and circuit board assembly. On the software side, we read official development documentation to set up the esp-idf development environment, studied how to implement functions like Bluetooth from example projects, and adapted them for our needs. After completing the individual module functionalities, I took the initiative to propose writing some API interfaces and usage examples to make calling these functional modules more convenient for the team.
Completing this project familiarized me with the fundamental software-to-hardware development flow, taught me the process of learning and developing from scratch, and gave me a preliminary understanding of the necessity of division of labor and collaboration in engineering projects. Subsequently, I participated in several other projects, engaging in deeper learning across various aspects of electronics. In developing these projects, I moved beyond merely achieving basic functionality and began to focus on engineering standards, code quality, and meeting various performance metrics.
A representative example is a robot designed for a logistics handling competition. In this project, I designed an STM32 expansion board, integrating crucial components like step-down modules, serial communication interfaces, power supply connectors, and signal lines. It also incorporated wireless relay switches and a wireless debugger, demonstrating more comprehensive considerations for power safety, signal isolation, and reliability compared to previous projects. I was also responsible for developing the robot's software control system, utilizing stepper motors in conjunction with a gyroscope to achieve precise and rapid movement of the four-wheeled chassis. I structured the code logically with clear encapsulation for various engineering modules, allowing for adaptable development and modification based on different functional requirements. Furthermore, I adopted more standardized code version control, facilitating collaborative development and modification within the team. Completing this project significantly enhanced my coding abilities, built more standardized engineering management and project development experience, and cultivated solid hardware-software practical expertise by being directly responsible for designing and implementing various functions from circuit design to software control. This gave me a more comprehensive understanding and appreciation of different branches within the field of electronics and reinforced my desire to explore complex system integration.
Throughout my theoretical studies and practical project work, I encountered numerous challenges and became aware of my limitations. When designing controllers, for instance, I was often limited to using only the simplest PID control and lacked sufficient understanding of more complex control theories required for optimal performance. Similarly, in PCB layout design, I realized I still had limited knowledge regarding critical aspects like signal integrity, high-speed routing techniques, and the underlying implementation principles of certain complex circuits. When developing robots and embedded systems, I remained somewhat uncertain about underlying instruction set architectures and the fundamental principles of program execution at a low level. Therefore, I am now eager to pursue further, in-depth study to gain a more profound and systematic understanding of these advanced topics.

**AI**

Transitioning from my undergraduate studies and project work, I am now seeking a more advanced academic environment to deepen my expertise, particularly in areas like complex control, advanced circuit design, and system architecture. The Master of Science in Information Engineering program at The Chinese University of Hong Kong presents a perfect opportunity to achieve this.
I am highly attracted to CUHK's IEMS program for its comprehensive curriculum, integrating hardware, software, and AI, which directly complements my automation background and aligns with my passion for smart systems. Courses like IEMS5727 Internet of Things and Smart Applications and IEMS5726 Data Science in Practice are particularly appealing. My project experience, from basic electronics to complex robotics, has shown me the importance of building connected, intelligent systems and the necessity of robust data analysis. These courses directly address these needs, promising to deepen my understanding and practical skills in creating sophisticated smart solutions.
Furthermore, the program's focus on practical deployment and scalability, highlighted in courses such as IEMS5780 Building and Deploying Scalable Machine Learning Services, is crucial for translating theoretical knowledge into impactful applications.
I am confident that CUHK's rigorous academic setting and distinguished faculty will provide the ideal environment to master these frontier technologies and enhance my research capabilities. My solid foundation and hands-on experience, combined with the resources at CUHK, will enable me to successfully contribute to and benefit from this program.
